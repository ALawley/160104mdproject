### Our Story
Founded in 1784, we have been serving the _finest_ curry known to man. When we first invented this delicacy we traveled many miles by foot to deliver it fresh to our **valued** customers. Now thanks to the wonders of technology we deliver by drone.
### Our Curry Philosophy

We believe curry should be served fresh, spicy, and piping hot.
> Put it in your face.
